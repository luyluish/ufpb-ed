# Task 1: Tic-tac-toe Unbeatable AI

Develop a bot capable of playing Tic-tac-toe. It must follow the rules below, which are ordered by a ranking of best possible plays for each in-game scenario. The rules must be tested from top to bottom, so R1 is supposed to be the best play.
 
- ``Rule 1`` If you or your opponent have a line of two symbols, mark the third remaining one.
 
- ``Rule 2`` If there is a space which will form two possible lines of two symbols, mark it.
 
- ``Rule 3`` If the central space is empty, mark it. 
 
- ``Rule 4`` If your opponent have marked a corner space, mark the opposite one.
 
- ``Rule 5`` If there is a empty corner, mark it.
 
- ``Rule 6`` Mark an arbitrary empty space.
