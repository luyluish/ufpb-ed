# Task 2: Selection Sort and Insertion Sort

Implement both of these sorting algorithms in the language of your preference, and compare their runtimes. You must allow the user to select the test case from a provided folder from the command line, and sort the numbers inside each file.
 
To run the program, you must run ``main.py`` following the desired test file as a console argument. In example:

``python main.py instancias-num/num.1000.1.in``

Will launch the script which will present you with 3 options:

- (1) Selection Sort

Runs selection sort and print the sorted array with execution time.

- (2) Insertion Sort

Runs insertion sort and print the sorted array with execution time.

- (3) Compare times

Runs both algorithms and print their execution times, for comparison purposes.
