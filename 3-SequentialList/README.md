# Task 3: Sequential List Implementation

This project implements a sequential list using an array in C++. The list supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, modification, and retrieval of elements inside the list.

## Features

- Inserting elements at a specific position.
- Removing elements from a specific position.
- Modifying elements at a specific position.
- Retrieving elements by their position.
- Checking if the list is empty or full.
- Getting the current size of the list.

## How to Run

To compile and run the program, use a C++ compiler such as g++. Example:

```sh
g++ main.cpp list.cpp -o list
./list
```

## Files

``list.h``: Header file defining the List class.

``list.cpp``: Implementation of the List class methods.

``main.cpp``: Contains the main function to demonstrate the list operations.
