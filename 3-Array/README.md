# Task 3: Array Implementation

This project implements an array vectors from C++. The array supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, modification, and retrieval of elements inside the array.

## Features

- Inserting elements at a specific position.
- Removing elements from a specific position.
- Modifying elements at a specific position.
- Retrieving elements by their position.
- Checking if the array is empty or full.
- Getting the current size of the array.

## How to Run

To compile and run the program, use a C++ compiler such as g++. Example:

```sh
g++ main.cpp array.cpp -o array
./array
```

## Files

``array.h``: Header file defining the Array class.

``array.cpp``: Implementation of the Array class methods.

``main.cpp``: Contains the main function to demonstrate the array operations.
